Scenario: reverse filtering zone: happy path
  Given PENDING Scenario: reverse filtering zone: happy path
  When I select "Cunningham Hall" from "request_building"
  Then "Unit 2" should be selected from "request_zone"
  And "Unit 1" should not be selected from "request_zone"
  Then all of the "areas" in "Cunningham Hall" should be in the "request_area" menu
  And all of the "areas" in "Martinez Commons" should not be in the "request_area" menu
